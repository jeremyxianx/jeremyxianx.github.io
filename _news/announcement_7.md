Our multi-year collaboration with Cisco Research (https://research.cisco.com/) has been featured in the news (https://research.umn.edu/units/techcomm/news/combining-academic-and-industry-research-modes-advance-machine-learning).
The quote, "**This collaboration is one of the most successful at Cisco Research and an example that industry research and academic research could follow**," comes from the Head of Cybersecurity Research.
As one of the leading student researchers, I feel very proud to be part of the team!
