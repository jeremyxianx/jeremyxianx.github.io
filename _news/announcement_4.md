Our paper titled ['A Unified Detection Framework for Inference-Stage Backdoor Defenses'](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=4zWEyYGGfI) has been accepted at **NeurIPS 2023**. In this paper, we developed a **unified framework** for defending against backdoor attacks in both computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) applications, achieving up to a **300%** improvement in terms of detection performance.
