I am Xun Xian, a fourth-year Ph.D. student at University of Minnesota, supervised by [Prof. Jie Ding](https://jding.org/) and [Prof. Mingyi Hong](https://people.ece.umn.edu/~mhong/mingyi.html). 

I am dedicated to investigating the **trustworthiness and safety of LLMs and Diffusion models**. Presently, my efforts are concentrated on developing **watermarking techniques** tailored for generative models, encompassing both diffusion and large language models, to ensure the safe use of generative AI.
